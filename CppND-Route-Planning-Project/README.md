I failed to download the whole project and run in local  
The project url is [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Route-Planning-Project)  
I cannot install io2d correctly at this time.  
So I used udacity online system to do the work.  
I will paste the changed code here.  
This may not be the best code, but it runned successful and tests passed on commit b42701f
